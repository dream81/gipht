<para>
This code will provide you with a mexfile that will read (not write)
certain ESRI shapefiles without having to purchase the Mapping Toolbox
from MATLAB.  By "certain shapefiles" I mean SHPT_POINT (point), 
SHPT_MULTIPOINT, SHPT_ARC, (simple polyline), or SHPT_POLYGON (simple
polygon).  There are a slew of other possibilities, but I have yet to run
into a shapefile that did not get classified as one of these four (the
code is written to throw an exception if an unknown type is encountered).
</para>

<para>
The mex file itself returns a structure for each shape that is read.
Because that can be a little annoying when dealing with point shapefiles,
a wrapper routine (shape_get.m) for the mex file is provided that
allows the user to optionally collect each of the points into a vector.
It's probably a good idea to use the wrapper routine exclusively.

	<title> Requirements </title>
	<para>
		Mexshape requires Matlab version R13 or higher.  
	</para>
	<para>
		Mexshape requires shapelib, or at least
		parts of it.  Shapelib is distributed
		under the LGPL and can be found at <ulink
		url="http://dl.maptools.org/dl/shapelib/">http://dl.maptools.org/dl/shapelib/</ulink>.
		It's uncertain to me from reading the LGPL if I can just
		package the few necessary files from shapelib along with
		mexshape or if I have to package the entire library.
		Since I definitely don't want to package the entire
		library, for now at least I will not distribute any
		part of shapelib.  If someone knows the answer to this,
		please tell me!
